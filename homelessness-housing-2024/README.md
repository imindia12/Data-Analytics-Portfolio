# Homelessness Housing Capacity in the U.S. (2024)

This project analyzes housing capacity for people experiencing homelessness across U.S. states using 2024 HUD data.

## Objective
To evaluate whether housing capacity (beds) aligns with homelessness need using Housing Inventory Count (HIC) and Point-in-Time (PIT) data.

## Data Sources
- HUD Housing Inventory Count (HIC), 2024
- HUD Point-in-Time (PIT) Count, 2024

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preparation in R
- Merging HIC and PIT datasets by state
- Creation of a beds-per-person metric
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization

## Key Insights
- Housing capacity is highly concentrated in a few states
- Beds-per-person varies widely across states
- Some states face significantly higher shortages relative to need

## Tools & Skills
R, tidyverse, data cleaning, data merging, EDA, data visualization
